u**N**natural **G**ravity **O**ptions calculator.  Quick and easy calculator to find values for artificial gravity.  Inputs are the radii of the inner and outer rings and the desired gravitational effect on the outer ring.  Outputs include the period, frequency, and rotation of the rings, the inner and outer rings' tangential velocities, and the inner ring's centripetal acceleration (gravitational effect).
